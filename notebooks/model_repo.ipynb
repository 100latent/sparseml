    "# Downloading from Neural Magic’s Model Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an easy step-by-step walkthrough for downloading a model from the Neural Magic Model Repository. You will:\n",
    "- Set up the environment\n",
    "- Select a model\n",
    "- Download the model\n",

    "Reading through this notebook will quickly provide an overview of the pretrained, performance-tuned models available in the Neural Magic Repo. This will take approximately:\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "Neural networks can take a long time to train. Model optimization techniques such as model pruning may be necessary to achieve both performance and optimization goals. However, these model optimizations can involve many trials and errors due to a large number of hyperparameters. Fortunately, in the computer vision and natural language space, pruned (sparsiﬁed) neural networks transfer learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to use pruned models, Neural Magic is actively:\n",
    "- Creating pruned versions of popular models and datasets\n",
    "- Thoroughly testing these models with the Neural Magic Inference Engine to ensure performance\n",
    "- Updating the Neural Magic Repo with these models and datasets\n"
