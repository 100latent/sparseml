    "# Kernel Sparsity via Pruning Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, in general, are very overparamatarized for given tasks (ie the number of parameters far exceeds the number of training points) yet still they [generalize very well](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530). This flies against conventional wisdom where overparamatarizing a model will lead to overfitting and puting theory behind this empirical evidence is a very active area of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, [early on](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-90b.pdf) it was discovered that large numbers of weights in neural networks could be pruned away (set to 0) without affecting the loss and in most cases actually improving the generalization capability of the network. This work was reinvigorated with Song Han's [2015 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149) in pursuit of compressing model size for mobile applications. This has resulted in numerous papers coming out on the topic of weight pruning, filter pruning, channel pruning, and ultimately block pruning. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09574) out of Google gives a good overview of the current state of sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that models are very overparamatarized and large numbers of weights can be effectively pruned away, what does this leave us with? Well intuitively, then, we can think of pruning as performing an [architecture search](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJlnB3C5Ym) within this large, traditionally fixed weight space. What was originally important in the dense model was representing a large number of pathways for optimization. We can then effectively remove the unused pathways in the optimization space with a fine toothed comb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well what does pruning get us? We now have a model with a lot of multiplications by zero that we don't need to run. If we're smart about how we do structure this compute (a suprisingly trickly problem), we can now run the model way faster than ever thought possible! That's where the [Neural Magic](http://neuralmagic.com/) engine can help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a step by step walk through for pruning an already trained (dense) model. Specifically it is setup to work with the model trained in our [model training tutorial](model_training.ipynb), but it can be changed to support other models/datasets as needed:\n",

    "## Pruning Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, sparsity is the degree in which a tensor is comprised of zeros. More formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "let $N^i$ be the total number of elements in a (e.g. weight) tensor $W_i$ and let $N^i_z$ be the number of elements which are zero-valued within that tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sparsity level associated with that tensor is then defined as $s_i \\triangleq \\dfrac{N^i_z}{N^i}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal now is to maximize the sparsity of each weight tensor within the model while preserving the accuracy of the densely trained version. The most robust and effective approach to this so far has been magnitude pruning. To frame the problem, let's say our goal is to go from an intial sparsity $N^i_{init}$ to a final sparsity $N^i_{final}$. We could start with changing out our usual $L_2$ weight regularization with $L_1$ [($L_2$ vs $L_1$)](https://towardsdatascience.com/l1-and-l2-regularization-methods-ce25e7fc831c) in our cost function. Following through, we would find that we did, in fact, introduce a few zeros into our weights. We created a direct pathway within the optimization problem such that the model is incentivized to reduce the magnitude of unimportant weights to 0 (unimportant are defined as weights that do not significantly contribute to the loss function). This is hard to balance, though. For example, how do we determine the proper weighting between the loss function and the regularization such that we reach a desired sparsity without sacrificing accuracy? Also, emperically we find that the model will settle in local mins thus failing to reduce further weights to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take this general idea to more of an extreme, though. Based on the previous thought experiment, it's reasonable to make an assumption that weights near zero are likely not important to the final loss function as well. Taking this even further, we could say that the smallest values within a given weight tensor are the ones least likely to affect our loss function. This is, of course, assuming that we've trained long enough to reach a stable point where our neural networks cost function has mimimized unimportant weights. Naturally, then, we could apply a schedule where we prune away a small number of smallest weights for every $M$ training steps. This is exactly what magnitude pruning does. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we go through a UI to setup a magntiude pruning schedule for our model. While pruning, some layers within a model will be more sensitive than others. A general rule is that the initial input layer and the final output layer are the most sensitive as they are an absolute bottleneck to the information flow. Because of this, we offer up a UI capable of creating very intricate schedules to the point that each layer could be pruned with a different schedule to a different final sparsity. In general, though, we can get by with pruning the initial and final layers minimally and the other layers equally. At Neural Magic we are actively working on automating this process to find the best possible pruning schedules to maximize performance while minimizing accuracy loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default for the below model will disable pruning for the initial and final layers and prune all other layers to 90% sparsity over the course of 10 epochs. The options available are described below:\n",
    "- Prune Epochs: number of epochs to apply the pruning over\n",
    "- Add New Group: add a new pruning group to the UI, used to prune selected layers to differnt sparsity levels at different rates\n",
    "- Delete Current Group: remove the current group from the pruning schedule\n",
    "- Tabs: the pruning groups setup so far, click to switch between\n",
    "- Sparsity: a range slider where the left value defines the sparsity level to initially start pruning at and the right value represents the final sparsity level\n",
    "- Start Epoch: the epoch to start pruning the selected layers at the initial sparsity\n",
    "- End Epoch: the epoch to finish pruning the selected layers to the final sparsity\n",
    "- Update Freq: the update frequency, in epochs, at which to prune the layers; ie 1.0 will prune every epoch\n",
    "- Selectable Layers: a dropdown of the layers available in the model that can be pruned along with their FLOPS and param counts; select the desired layers to prune using the checkboxes"

    "### Learning Rate Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "With our magnitude pruning schedule complete, we need to define the hyperparameters for training while pruning. The most important of these is the learning rate. Too high and we will diverge from our initial dense solution. Too low and we will have to train for too many epochs. Below we run a learning rate sensitivty analysis from the [cyclic LR paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the sensitivity analysis we will begin training the model at a very small learning rate ($10^{-7}$) where the weight updates will be lost in floating point precision errors (ie we won't learn). After each batch we exponentially increase the learning rate until we reach a very high learning rate ($10^0$) where we are guaranteed to diverge from our trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A flat region will be apparent in the graph starting from the left to some point at the right for a fully trained model. After this we reach a critical learning rate where the loss begins to rapidly rise. This is the critical point where we begin diverging from the local minimum in our optimization space. Using this information, we can find the maximum and minimum learning rates to use in a cyclic learning rate with our [SGD + nesterov momentum optimizer](https://towardsdatascience.com/stochastic-gradient-descent-with-momentum-a84097641a5d) for training. Cyclic learning rates allows quicker exploration and convergence within an optimization space than a standard stepped learning rate. See the cyclic LR paper linked above for more information. Another optimizer or a non cyclic approach can be used as well. In that case the learning rate sensitivity analysis gives a good range for the initial learning rate to set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good defaults for minimum and maximum learning rates are given for the default model and dataset. If changing either, you will need to update the learning rates. A good rule of thumb is to set the minimum to $10^{-4}$ and the maximum to a value a little before the critical point found in the sensitivity analysis."
